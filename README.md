It might be useful to broaden our views on medicine - perhaps as much as accept that medicine itself should not be the focus of our thinking. It may make sense to try and get a larger group of people together, to work on sharing knowledge and understanding viewpoints, and to try and see if we agree on goals.

Often, we doctors assume we know what is best for our patient. In a sense, we do, but there is a growing movement of questoning the traditional "best". In addition, societal and technological changes are moving at such a pace that it would be naive to think that our old values and ideas will be intricate enough for the challenges of the future.

So it is time to abandon the old, authoritative medicine, and instead embrace a system leadership mindset - to give people the space and tools to come together and work together for a better - not just healthier - future.
